If facing any issues, alternate commands are `dart pub global run rename` or `flutter pub global run rename`. For path variable issues, refer to [ensuring your path variables are set up correctly](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/glossary#system-cache).

## Troubleshooting

#### Command Not Working on Windows

If you encounter issues running the `rename` command directly in Windows, especially from a non-administrator terminal, you might need to use an alternative command format. This issue can arise due to permission restrictions or path variable misconfigurations.

Try executing the command using one of the following formats:

- Using Flutter:
  ```sh
  flutter pub run rename <command> [arguments]
  ```
- Using Dart:
  ```sh
  dart run rename <command> [arguments]
  ```

These alternative commands explicitly invoke the `rename` tool through the Dart or Flutter toolchain, which can bypass some of the path or permission issues encountered in certain Windows configurations.
